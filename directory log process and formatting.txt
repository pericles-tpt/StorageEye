For C drive should only need to go two levels deep with an exception for the "Users" folder, these are all the "Big" folders on my drive
C:\Users\firstname lastname\.. [3]
C:\Program Data\.. [2]
C:\Program Files\.. (x86) [2]
C:\Program Files\.. [2]
C:\Games\.. [2]

For other drives (D:\, E:\, etc) can also go two layers deep unless the user 
states otherwise

C:\Windows [2] -> should have different behaviour for this folder i.e. If there
is a remaining capacity delta between old and new log should redirect to windows
in-built system cleanup functionality for user to rectify

Even though the drive "scan" only goes 2 to 3 levels deep the user can be given
the option to "investigate" a folder which will do a full scan as deep as possible
into the folder and give a readout of the biggest folders and files 

For writing folder\files to txt file should compare current directory entries to 
"old" dirlog file and if an entry doesn't exist it should be added to both the new
and the old file

E.G. with new entry 2C:\Program Files\theme gen|200MB
2C:\Program Files\steam|10GB          2C:\Program Files\steam|10GB
2C:\Program Files\trello|500MB        2C:\Program Files\theme gen|200MB
                                      2C:\Program Files\trello|500MB

ELEMENT STORED IN BUFFER TO WRITE TO FILE E.G. ("3C:\Program Files\Prime 95|25M")
SIZE ~ 1 + 3 + 51 + 50 + 4 = 109 bytes?
